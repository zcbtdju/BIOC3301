# BIOC3301
All batch codes used in project report data analysis.

Standard workflow:
Map validation.
Join paired reads.
Demultiplex.
OTU picking - option to use SILVA reference database with open reference UCLUST clustering not available, hence manual assignment of taxonomy and formation of otu table (OTU table is read to obtain sampling depth (-e) for diversity analysis).
Diversity analysis - for alpha and beta diversity metrics.
UPGMA phylogenetic tree.
Statistical tests - ANOSIM (-c = UPGMA clustering), BIO-ENV (-c = UPGMA clustering and longitude) and db-RDA (-c = distance).

Merged 15/16, 16/17 & 17/18 datasets workflow:
Concatinated map validation.
Join paried reads - 17/18 only, due to poor quality Read2 in 15/16 and 16/17 datasets.
Demultiplex - run independently for each dataset.
OTU picking - run independently for each dataset, closed reference UCLUST clustering with SILVA 128 reference database (timing errors restricted use of open reference).
OTU tables merged - OTU table is read to obtain sampling depth (-e) for diversity analysis).
Diversity analysis - for alpha and beta diversity metrics.
UPGMA phylogenetic tree.
Statistical tests - ANOSIM (-c = UPGMA clustering), (-c = rainfall - presence/absence of rain), (-c = rainfallmm - amount of rain).

GreenGenes workflow:
Map validation.
Join paired reads.
Demultiplex.
OTU picking - open reference UCLUST clustering with GreenGenes 13_8 reference databas, timing error hence manaul sequence alignment, taxonomy asssignment, phylogenetic tree formation and OTU table formation (with OTU table read to obtain sampling depth (-e) for diversity analysis).
Diversity analysis - for alpha and beta diversity metrics.

Stringent workflow:
Map validation.
Join paired reads.
Demultiplex.
OTU picking - option to use SILVA reference database with open reference UCLUST clustering not available, hence manual assignment of taxonomy and formation of otu table (OTU table is read to obtain sampling depth (-e) for diversity analysis).
Diversity analysis - for alpha and beta diversity metrics.
